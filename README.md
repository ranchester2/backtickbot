# Backtickbot
A crappy bot that informs about backtick codeblock syntax

### Inspiration
Saw that a subreddit had a automoderator informing of this.
### How to run?
Create a folder called `runtime`
and in it put:

* `dmmode.json` - content should be `[]`
* `responses.json` - content should be `[]`
* `optout.json` - content should be `[]`

Have python, etc installed. Run `start_deploy.sh`
